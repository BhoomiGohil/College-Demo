                 We believe that knowledge empowers people to do great things in this world.
                 We also believe that you shouldn't have to put your life on hold to gain that knowledge.
                 The idea of distance education is not a new concept for us.
                 We've been offering Penn State courses at a distance for more than 100 years.
                 In 1892, Penn State founded one of the nation's first correspondence courses.
                 And in 1998, we were one of the first major accredited universities to provide online education.
                 At Penn State World Campus, our mission is making sure you have access to a quality academic experience,
                 even if you have job and family obligations to fulfill.
                 If you can not come to one of our brick-and-mortar campuses, we'll bring our campus to you.
